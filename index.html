<h1>
    Cookie Quest
</h1>
<p>
    Get ready for a delightful and challenging adventure in the world of cookies, strategy, and sweet surprises. Cookie
    Quest is a game inspired by the classic Minesweeper, with a tasty twist. Instead of dodging bombs, players are on a
    quest to uncover and flag 20 delicious cookies hidden beneath the grid. Can you satisfy your sweet tooth and emerge
    victorious?
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> In Cookie Quest, your mission is to place 20 flags on the grid to mark the locations
        of 20 hidden cookies. The goal is to uncover all the cookies without accidentally flagging the wrong spots.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Grid:</strong> The game board is a grid of squares, just like in Minesweeper. Each square is a potential
        location for a cookie. Some squares contain cookies, while others do not.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Flags:</strong> You have a total of 20 flags at your disposal. These flags represent your guesses about
        where the cookies are hidden.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Player's Turn:</strong> The game proceeds in turns, with each player taking their time to make strategic
        decisions.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Uncovering Squares:</strong> On your turn, you can select a square to uncover. If the square contains a
        cookie, you're one step closer to victory! If it's empty, you'll see a number indicating how many cookies are
        adjacent to that square.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Placing Flags:</strong> To place a flag, simply select a square you believe contains a cookie and mark
        it with a flag. Be cautious, though, as you only have 20 flags, and you don't want to run out!
    </li>

    <li><strong>Winning:</strong> To win Cookie Quest, you must successfully place all 20 flags on the squares that hide
        cookies. If you uncover a square that does not contain a cookie, you lose the game.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Play:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Start the game:</strong> Set up the game board with a grid of squares, some containing cookies and
        others empty. The locations are hidden from the players.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Take turns:</strong> Players take turns selecting squares to uncover. If they uncover a cookie, they
        make progress. If they uncover an empty square, they receive information about nearby cookies.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Place flags:</strong> Players can use their 20 flags to mark squares they believe contain cookies.
        Placing flags strategically is key to winning.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Deduction and strategy:</strong> As you progress, you'll need to use the information gathered from
        uncovered squares to make educated guesses about the locations of cookies.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Victory:</strong> To win Cookie Quest, you must successfully place all 20 flags on the squares that hide
        cookies. A sweet victory awaits the clever and strategic players!
